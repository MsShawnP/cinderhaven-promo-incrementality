"""Walking-skeleton pipeline step: schema, contract values, and determinism.

Determinism is a stated arc requirement — same pinned package + same code must
produce byte-identical artifacts — and nothing else in this repo checks it yet.
This is where that gets asserted, on the one artifact that exists.
