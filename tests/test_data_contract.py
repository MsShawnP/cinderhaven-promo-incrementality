"""The consumer contract, asserted rather than trusted.

This is the whole interface to `cinderhaven-promo-response`: two frames from
`pr.load()`, observed columns only. If any of it drifts, every downstream
number drifts with it and nothing else in this repo would notice.

Green on a cold cache since upstream v0.1.1 (SHA 7cfe95c). In v0.1.0
`pr.load()` raised FileNotFoundError on the first call in any fresh install —
the consumer serve path rewrote a source file absent from the wheel — so this
job was red on every CI run (cold cache) and passed only on a warm local one.
The upstream packaging fix removed that asymmetry; the pin was moved to v0.1.1
in the same change that flipped this green. See FAILURES.md and DECISIONS.md.
